The Al Bhed language is a special language from Final Fantasy X spoken by the Al Bhed. The language largly varies from the English spoken by many of the other races in Spira. However, it isn't a language in the true definition of the word. The Al Bhed language is in reality a cypher. It is only considered a language, because the Japanese version of the game called it the 'Aru Bedo go', which translates to 'Al Bhed language'.
